Any easy way to copy files between terminals or computers on a local network.

Note: bcp currently assumes a trusted network, use with caution

Compiling

  or
  gcc -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -o bcp bcp.c

Example
-------
::

  diginux@heisenberg:~/code/bcp/test$ ./bcp awesome.jpg
  Listening for request..
  Sending file to: 192.168.2.12:10789
  Sent 107545
  File sent.

  Jordans-MacBook-Pro:bcp diginux$ ./bcp
  Requesting file..
  Incoming connection from: 192.168.2.12
